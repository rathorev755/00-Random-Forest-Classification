"Palmer Penguins" dataset, to understand how changing hyperparameters can change classification results.
The Data
We will work with the "Palmer Penguins" dataset, as it is simple enough to help us fully understand how changing hyperparameters can change classification results.

Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

Simplified data from original penguin data sets. Contains variables:

* species: penguin species (Chinstrap, Ad√©lie, or Gentoo)
* culmen_length_mm: culmen length (mm)
* culmen_depth_mm: culmen depth (mm)
* flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)
* body_mass_g: body mass (g)
* island: island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in the Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica)
* sex: penguin sex
